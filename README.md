A discord bot written in python with pycord for more functionality.
I am using pomice for the music support and created a bash script 
to set the parameters and automate the bot's autostart with systems.

## Installing
``` 
git clone https://github.com/BlacklightYT/python-discord-bot/
```
```
cd python-discord-bot
```
```
python3.10 -m pip install -r  requirements.txt
```
> Installing the requirements could take longer when using a low end device [Was the case on my old tv box with linux]

## Using the setup-wizard
> We need sudo trust me bro
```
sudo python3.10 setup-wizard.py
```
> If you encounter problems using the setup-wizard you could of course contact me :)

## Usage
```
python3.10 bot_init.py
```
